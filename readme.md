## by Walaa Elnozahy

## Dataset

> PISA stands for "The Program for International Student Assessment" which is an international assessment that measures students who are 15-year-old. it aims to assess their skills such as reading, mathematics, and science literacy every 3 years. This data is gathered from gathered done for students who are about to end their education. they are assessing their level and skills  along with details about them to check how well prepared they are for life beyond school.


## Summary of Findings

>  to sum this up the main visible relation is the effect of parents education on student's score and performance which increase when parents have higher education. 
> the second relation, was the only feasiable correlation that was shown which shows a slight effect for outschool study "Out_StudyTime_Homework" which has correlatoin with the score with around 0.2


## Key Insights for Presentation

> In the presentation, I started of with showing detials about the data and dataset, then started with my first doubt of investigating  which is the parents education and to check check if parents education does affect the score. then checked the effect of the parents educations compared with student's gender and their score.
> the result showed that the average of students score decrease with parents who have low education and gradually increase with the increase of learning level. also it seems that the mean for the males is always slightly higher than the male's mean 
> the seocnd key which is importatnt is studying hours effect on student score by checking all studying types then comparing the sum of these studying time and compare it with score. 
it seemed not useful then only found that one studying type has effect on student score.
